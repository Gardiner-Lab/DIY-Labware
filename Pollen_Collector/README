Cyclone dust separators are commonplace in woodshops and I thought one would work really well to help with the collection of pollen. So I designed one that can be taken apart and cleaned in between uses to prevent cross-contamination.

This needs to be combined with a vacuum of choice, an additional length of hose such as (https://a.co/d/i8PEjkn), and 80-micron mesh.

The length of the hose can be cut down to size, I cut the one I linked to into 2.5ft sections and it worked great (using the full length will cause a loud whistling).

The 80-micron mesh goes over the end of the hose to prevent unwanted plant material from being sucked up.

There are threads in the bottom so a 50ml falcon tube can be screwed tight to the bottom.

Only the main body requires support material and only over where the tube extends out. the rest of the body and pieces print without support material.

I attached everything together using duct tape to seal around the lid (probably not needed its a snug fit) and the hose.
