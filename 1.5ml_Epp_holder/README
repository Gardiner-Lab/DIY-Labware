#Read me

#I designed this box to put my Eppendorf tubes in during incubation step of transformaiton protocols, this allows me to lie the tube on its side in the shaker without the worry of the tube popping open.

# Can print without supports if oriented in the correct way.

# no brim needed

#I currently use this on an almost daily basis and it has worked well.
